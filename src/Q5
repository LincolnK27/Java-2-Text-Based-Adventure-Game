5. No issues in merging the main branch to my personal one. Took me a bit to figure out how to do it, but I didn't run into any errors, at least so far. There was some issue when we first created the repository, wherein we had to re-create it I believe, since some things started going missing, but that was before we were working with merging it all. Merging specifically had no issues, my personal branch was updated to the same level as the main branch easily, no issues.
