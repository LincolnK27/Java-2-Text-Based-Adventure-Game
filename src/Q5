5. No issues in merging the main branch to my personal one. 
Took me a bit to figure out how to do it, but I didn't run into any errors, at least so far. 
There was some issue when we first created the repository, wherein we had to re-create it I believe, 
since some things started going missing, but that was before we were working with merging it all. 
Merging specifically had no issues, my personal branch was updated to the same level as the main branch easily, no issues.

I also had no issues merging too and from the main branch to our individual dev branches,
and we did have some issues when we first generated the source files, but a quit delete and repush to main fixed it right up.
I have merged at least four to five times as we all implemented some of our own ideas and fixes and I look forward
to the final product!

I had no issues or conflicts merging at first time, but second time I messed my branch with Main and had to revert this merge and
re-merch to mine again. Also, the issue we all had at the beginning was already described by Indira and Lincoln above.
